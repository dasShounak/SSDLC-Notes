### Need for SSDLC

- High connectivity in the world leads to huge threat environment
- Attacker can access private and sensitive data or use compromised system to attack other users
- The cost-benefit ratio is defined by Clark and Davis (1995)


$$M_{b}+ P_{b}> O_{cp} + O_{cm}P_{a}P_{c}$$  
$M_{b}$ = Monetary benefit of attacker  
$P_b$ = Psychological benefit of attacker  
$O_{cp}$ = Cost of committing the crime  
$O_{cm}$ = Monetary costs of conviction (legal costs)  
$P_a$ = probability of getting arrested  
$P_c$ = probability of conviction for the attacker  

- Privacy is a way of *complying* with policy 
- Security is a way of *enforcing* the policy

### Critical Mass

- There must be enough knowledgeable people reviewing enough of the code often enough
- A critical mass of experienced and willing eyes makes all bugs shallow

### Proprietary Software Development Methods

- CMMI
	- **capability maturity model integration**
	- maturity level
		- foundation for *continuous process development*
	- lower level -> higher risk, lower quality
	- levels (IMDQO)
		- initial
		- managed
		- defined
		- quantitatively managed
		- optimizing
- TSP
	- **team software process**
	- team concepts in development
	- steps
		- establish goals
		- define team roles
		- assessing risks
		- producing team plan
- PSP
	- **personal software process**
	- helps in developing skills at a personal level
	- levels
		- PSP 0  - measurements,  coding standards
		- PSP 1 - time and scheduling
		- PSP 2 - personal quality management and code reviews
		- PSP 3- personal process evolution

## Unit 2

### Risk Management Framework (RMF)

- RMF - philosophy for software security
- Its a lifecycle
- Identifying and keeping track of risks
- Occurs in parallel with SDLC activities
- Not time consuming
	- Automation - large companies
	- Small teams - medium companies
	- Individual part-time task - small companies
- Threats - events that could cause harm potentially
- Vulnerability - weakness in IT systems
- Impact - measurement of how severe the harm could be
- Likelihood - measurement of risk factor 
- Predisposing conditions - factors that increase/decrease impact or likelihood
	- Risk = Threat x Vulnerability x impact/asset value
	- Level of Risk = Consequence x Likelihood
- Stages (UISDF)
	- understand business context
	- identify business and technical risks
	- synthesize and prioritize risks 
	- define risk mitigation strategy
	- fix and validate 
- risk metrics
	- risk likelihood
	- risk impact
	- risk severity
	- number of risks emerging and mitigated over time

### Stage 1: Understanding Business Goals

- business goals are neither obvious nor explicitly stated
- the analyst must extract and describe business goals, priorities, and circumstances 
- Business goals include but are not limited to increasing revenue, meeting *service-level agreements (SLAs)*, reducing development costs, and generating high *return on investment (ROI).* 
- Ask "Who cares?"

### Stage 2: Identify Business and Technical Risks

- **Business Risks:**
  - Threaten business goals with impacts like financial loss, brand damage, regulatory violations.
  - Severity expressed in financial terms (market share, cost).

- **Business Risk Identification:**
  - Clarifies and quantifies events impacting goals.
  - Foundation for technical methods in software risk mitigation.

- **Tying Technical Risks to Business Context:**
  - Essential for effective risk management.
  - Thorough identification and understanding are crucial.

- **Discovering and Describing Technical Risks:**
  - Central to RMF, involves situations counter to planned system design.
  - Examples: unexpected behavior, design violations.

- **Impacts of Technical Risks:**
  - Include system crashes, control avoidance, unauthorized data modification.

- **Technical Risk Identification Support:**
  - Supported by software security touchpoints.

### Stage 3: Synthesize and Prioritize Risks

- prioritization of risks leads directly to creation of value. 
- Answers the "Who cares?" question
- which business goals are the most important to the organization, which goals are immediately threatened
- Risk metrics
	- likelihood
	- impact
	- severity
	- number of risks emerging and mitigated over time

### Stage 4: Define Risk Mitigation Strategy

- **Security Challenge:**
  - Analysts find issues but lack clear solutions.
  - Mitigation strategy is essential for a robust risk analysis.

- **Fixing Complexity:**
  - Widespread among security consultants.
  - Designing resilience is harder than finding vulnerabilities.

- **Mitigation Strategy Focus:**
  - Develop cost-effective strategy post risk identification.
  - Considers cost, time, success likelihood, completeness, and impact.

- **Strategic Constraints:**
  - Aligned with business context.
  - Considers affordability, integration, and organizational understanding.
  - Emphasizes direct validation techniques.

- **Metrics in Mitigation:**
  - Financial metrics applied: cost takeout, ROI, method effectiveness, and risk coverage percentage.


### Stage 5: Carry out Fixes and Validate

- Problems must be rectified
- progress should be measured in terms of completeness against the risk
- validation provides confidence that the risks have been properly mitigated
- testing can be carried out


## Unit 3

### Architectural Risk Analysis

- identifies flaws in a software architecture
- determines risks to business information assets that result from those flaws
- Stages (RATCTF)
	- Requirements
	- Architecture and Design
	- Test plans
	- Codes
	- Test Results
	- Feedback
- Steps (AARR)
	- Asset Identification
	- Architectural Risk Analysis
		- Threats
		- Vulnerabilities
	- Risk Mitigation
	- Risk Management and Measurement
- Prototypical Risk Analysis
	- Learn
	- Discuss security issues
	- Determine probability of compromise
	- Impact analysis
	- Rank risks
	- Report findings
- Forest level view
	- building a consistent view of the target system
	- idea is to see the forest and not get lost in the trees
	- One-page overview or forest view - the big picture
		- UML diagrams

### Risk calculation

$ALE = SLE \times ARO$

ALE = Annual Loss Expectancy
SLE = Single Loss Expectancy
ARO = Annual Rate of Occurrence

## Unit 4

### Code Review with a Tool

- Debugging is at least twice as hard as programming
- If your code is as clever as you can possibly make it, then by definition you're not smart enough to debug it.
- All software projects are guaranteed to have one artifact in commonâ€”*source code.*
- large number of security problems are caused by simple bugs
- code review is about finding and fixing bugs.
- Using a tool makes sense because code review is boring, difficult, and tedious.
- Code review is critical for the following reasons:
	- no bugs in code
	- minimize having issues
	- new code adheres to guidelines
	- efficiency of new code
- cause of bugs
	- missing semicolons
	- most programming languages were not designed with security in mind
	- misuse of functions

### Static Analysis

- examine text of program statically
- manual auditing
	- can be time consuming
- tools are faster
- can be applied before program reaches a level of completion
- The earlier security risks are identified and managed in the software lifecycle, the better.

### Binary Analysis

- Source code analyzers are particularly useful when you're building software
- When no source code?
	- attackers really don't need source code to find vulnerabilities and develop exploits 
	- *disassemblers* and *decompilers* are tools that feature prominently in the attacker's toolkit.
	- binary analysis is important
- threat assessment and security assessment framework at a *binary level of code*
- **static application security testing (SAST)** is a technological toolset that can analyze various static codes, like binary code, byte code, and application source code while they are in a non-running state
